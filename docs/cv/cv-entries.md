# CV Entries for UFSA v2

## For a Data Architect / Data Engineer Role

This version emphasizes the high-level architecture and the data-centric nature of the project.

**UFSA v2: Declarative, Federated Interoperability Engine**

* Architected and developed a Python-based engine to ingest, normalize, and map heterogeneous data standards (e.g., FHIR, ISO, Shopify) into a unified, SKOS-grounded model to enable cross-domain analytics.
* Designed a declarative and extensible pipeline using a YAML registry and pluggable parsers, reducing the effort required to integrate new data sources.
* Implemented a novel artifact tracking system using SHA256 hashes to ensure data pipeline integrity, prevent drift, and guarantee reproducible outputs.
* Automated project governance by creating a cryptographic sealing tool to manage licensing and verify the integrity of the software supply chain.

## For a Senior Python Developer Role

This version focuses on your Python expertise, tooling, and software engineering best practices.

**UFSA v2: Professional-Grade Python Application**

* Developed a robust, configuration-driven Python application to solve complex data interoperability challenges, complete with a full suite of tests (`pytest`), modern linting (`ruff`), and CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions).
* Engineered a pluggable parser system to handle diverse data formats (JSON Schema, CSV, RDF), demonstrating expertise in data modeling and transformation.
* Built sophisticated command-line tooling for developers, including a comprehensive `Makefile` and a custom-built utility for ensuring source code integrity via cryptographic sealing.
* Authored clear, comprehensive documentation and followed modern packaging standards (`pyproject.toml`, `uv`), ensuring the project is easy for others to adopt and contribute to.

## For a Software Architect / Tech Lead Role

This version is a concise, high-impact summary that highlights leadership, design, and security.

**UFSA v2: Federated Interoperability Engine**

* Led the end-to-end design and implementation of a federated system for semantic data interoperability, grounding the architecture in the W3C SKOS standard to ensure correctness and industry alignment.
* Pioneered a "governance-as-code" approach by building automated tooling to manage software licensing and cryptographically verify source code integrity, addressing software supply chain security concerns.
* Delivered a highly extensible and maintainable solution by employing a declarative configuration model and a pluggable component architecture.
